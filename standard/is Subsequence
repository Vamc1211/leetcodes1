A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the 
relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        i=0
        for let in t:
            if i==len(s):
                return True
            if s[i]==let:
                i+=1
        return i==len(s)
