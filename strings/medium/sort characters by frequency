Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.
Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

 Example 1:

Input: s = "tree"
Output: "eert"
Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.

code:
from collections import Counter
class Solution:
    def frequencySort(self, s: str) -> str:
        d = Counter(s)
        res = []
        for k,v in sorted(d.items(), key = lambda x:x[1],reverse=True):
            res.append(k*v)

        return ''.join(res)
